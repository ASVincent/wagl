# GAIP

Geoscience Australia Image Processor

## Instructions (quickstart)

Note this is an older branch of gaip, which is preserved as an interim solution for maintaining a downstream product (WOfS).

These instructioned are tailored to NCI/Raijin system.

First, open terminal (ssh raijin).

Obtain and prepare gaip software and environment. E.g., git checkout and make. Optionally the installation may already be configured on the system as a loadable module:

``` 
module use /g/data/v10/private/modules/modulefiles
module load gcc/5.2.0 core
```
